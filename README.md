**Clinic Account Project Description**

Clinic Account is a professional **freelance marketplace platform**, similar to Upwork, designed to connect clients and freelancers. The platform enables clients to post projects, create milestones, and hire freelancers to complete their work efficiently.

The system is built with a **React.js frontend** for a seamless user experience, while the **backend API and admin panel are powered by Laravel (PHP framework)** to ensure scalability and robust performance.

For financial transactions, Clinic Account integrates **Stripeâ€™s payment gateway with an escrow system**. This ensures secure payments by holding client funds in escrow when a project milestone is created. Once a freelancer successfully completes a milestone, the client can release the payment directly from escrow, providing transparency and security for both parties.

With its streamlined workflow, Clinic Account offers:

* **Clients**: Ability to post projects, define milestones, and securely manage payments.
* **Freelancers**: Opportunities to apply for projects, complete milestones, and receive payments safely.
* **Admin**: A centralized panel to oversee projects, users, payments, and dispute resolution.
